We invite presenters to submit talk proposals to present high-quality work with sufficient background
material to be clear to the HPC, Big Data, and/or Data Science communities.
Talk proposals should be submitted through the official FOSDEM'26 submission system:
[https://pretalx.fosdem.org/fosdem-2026/cfp](https://pretalx.fosdem.org/fosdem-2026/cfp).

Submissions must include:

- Talk title + abstract + description (plain text or MarkDown, couple of paragraphs)
- Expected prior knowledge / intended audience
- Speaker(s) bio
- Links to code / slides / material for the talk (optional)
- Links to previous talks by the speaker (optional)

Our intention is to have a series of talks of about 20 minutes each, with an additional 5-10 minutes for questions by attendees.

We would also like to note:

- All accepted talks will be about (using) free and open source software.<br/>We highly discourage "marketing" talks.
- All talks will be given *in-person* at FOSDEM in Brussels, on Sunday 1 February 2026.<br/>
  <strong>Please take this into account when submitting your talk.</strong><br/>
  Remote or pre-recorded presentations will unfortunately not be possible.
